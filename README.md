# Crappy
Let's refactor some code to make it crappy

## Rules
In small groups :
* Choose a code in a language you want to work with (C#, Java, Scala)
* Your objective : make it so crappy that other groups won't be able to understand it
* During 30 minutes, you have to crappy the production code
  * Be creative
  * The more brainfuck it is the better
  * Tests are green before and at the end of your refactoring
* After this period of time : present the new version of the production code
  * Other groups have 2 minutes to identify what is implemented
